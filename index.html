    <p>This story is about a girl who finds herself at a crossroads in a mysterious forest. Where she has to choose a direction to go. 
        If she chooses left she encounters a magical beast. Where she runs away or knows more about the forest by taking it. 
        If she runs away she finds a portal that can lead to a new dimension. Or if she chooses right she will find a hidden chest with cold coins which she can take or leave alone.
        
        The story is structured as a series of stages, each represented by an object with properties like text, choices, consequences, and image.
        Functions are defined to start the game, display each stage of the story, navigate to the next stage based on user choices, and end the game.
        Event listeners are attached to buttons dynamically created for each choice, allowing users to interact with the story and progress through different stages.
        The game starts automatically when the page loads, displaying the initial stage of the story.</p>
